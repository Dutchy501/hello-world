easy hello world program

/*So, I'm currently active duty within the Air Force and have been serving for just over 20 years.
While my occupation within the air force isn't related to computer science, I've always enjoyed
working with technology.  I started pursing computer science about 2 years ago after having an 
interest in cyber security.  After taking some programming classes in C++, I realized that I enjoy 
coding or really, making something that works.  I feel I still have a lot to learn, but when I do
create a program and it runs successfully, I truely enjoy the satisfaction from it.  I'm hoping
to sharpen my programming skills and make stuff that can benifit society*/
